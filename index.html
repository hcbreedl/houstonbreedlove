            A mentor of mine told me "there are two types of developers:<br />
            1st type enjoys working with the most modern and cutting edge tools.<br />
            2nd just enjoys building...
          </p>
          <p>
            I don't care if you ask me to build you a house with the nicest tools or if you simply give me a hammer and some nails...
            I enjoy the process and the fulfillment of seeing the house built."
          </p>
          <p>
            This is a quote that I agree with and empathize with.

              <p>
                I graduated from the University of North Carolina, Greensboro with a bachelors of arts in Religious Studies.
              </p>
              <p>
                I worked full time while putting myself through university at Lee Brothers Martial Arts Academy
               as a General Manager.
              </p>
              <p>
                At that time, my goals were completely different and not aligned with web development in any way.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, as a professional working developer now, I realize that the skills I acquired during that time
                are actually quite valuable and were a primer to coding success.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Some of the most transferable of skills, I've found, are:
                </li>
                <li>
                  - Critical Thinking
                </li>
                <li>
                  - Attention to detail
                </li>
                <li>
                  - Clear verbal and written communication
                </li>
                <li>
                  - Logical Reasoning
                </li>
                <li>
                  - Problem solving
                </li>
                <li>
                  - Empathy

                Martial arts was a major role in my life for most of my life. The discipline instilled during my martial arts times carries through to my constant and humble learning of web development.
              </p>
              <p>
                As of current, I am a World Tae Kwon Do Federation certified 4th degree black belt and spent extensive time living and training in Korea training under the 2000 Sydney Olympics gold medalist.
                During this time, I also trained (mostly) with members of the Korean national team, as well as other visiting countries teams including France, Algeria, and Australia.
              </p>
              <p>
                I met my beautiful wife, who also holds black belts in both Tae Kwon Do and Judo, through martial arts while she was an intern studying business operations at the academy where I was General Manager.
              </p>
              <p>
                I originally moved to the Durham area, with my wife, to open our own martial arts academy. But instead found myself working at the front desk of the 21c Museum Hotels in downtown Durham, NC.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div id="test6">
              <p>
                While working at the 21c Museum Hotel, I applied to be a part of the inaugural class of The Coding Boot Camp at UNC Chapel Hill and was accepted!
              </p>
              <p>
                The course was a part-time course that met 3x a week for 6 months, during which I studied various full stack technologies including:
              </p>
              <p>
                Backend: SQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Firebase, Node/npm, Sequelize, and Express.js<br />
                Frontend: HTML, CSS, Sass, Bootstrap, Materialize, Javascipt/Jquery, Handlebars.js, and React.
              </p>
              <p>
                While enrolled...<br />
                We were also lucky enough to have many guest speakers from local companies come to speak to the class about working in real world development environments, Agile, and scrum methodologies.<br />
                We also got to go to various local companies to do office tours so we could network with successful developer professionals.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div id="test7">
              <p>
                Halfway through The Coding Boot Camp, with confidence, I took a calculated risk, quit my job at the hotel, and focused on finding my first developer position full time.
              </p>
              <p>
                Two weeks later, I was brought on as Product Development Intern at inMotionNow. The internship was to be a 3 month internship but after 2 months I was brought into a full time position as .Net Developer.
                Note, however, that I had no previous experience with .Net, C#, or Visual Basic but due to my success in showing that I could learn quickly, I was able to convince my team that I would be positive contributing
                teammate.
              </p>
              <p>
                While, at this point, I felt that I had achieved a significant goal in making a complete career shift, I DID realize as well that it was the only a new beginning. My new goal is to keep myself in a position
                that I can continue to constantly learn and surround myself with people that I can learn from.
              </p>
              <p>
                I've found that I find the most joy in solving problems and that often, the harder it is to solve the problem, the greater the sense of accomplishment.

                      Schedulr was the project I was most proud of coming out of the UNC Chapel Hill Coding Boot Camp. Why?
                      Because this was the successful completion of a MERN stack application.  We accomplished our goal of delivering
                      what we as a group, agreed to achieve within 2 weeks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The idea of Schedulr was to begin coming up with a way for a manager to manage scheduling for his/her employees.

                      we decided to do what we could to try and find a simplistic solution for keeping track of grades in a classroom.
